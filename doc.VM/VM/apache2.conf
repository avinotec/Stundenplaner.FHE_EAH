# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ for detailed information about
# the directives and /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian about Debian specific
# hints.
#
#
# Summary of how the Apache 2 configuration works in Debian:
# The Apache 2 web server configuration in Debian is quite different to
# upstream's suggested way to configure the web server. This is because Debian's
# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,
# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in
# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as
# possible.

# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined
# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:
#
#	/etc/apache2/
#	|-- apache2.conf
#	|	`--  ports.conf
#	|-- mods-enabled
#	|	|-- *.load
#	|	`-- *.conf
#	|-- conf-enabled
#	|	`-- *.conf
# 	`-- sites-enabled
#	 	`-- *.conf
#
#
# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces
#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the
#   web server.
#
# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is
#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be
#   customized anytime.
#
# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/
#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,
#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,
#   respectively.
#
#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their
#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our
#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See
#   their respective man pages for detailed information.
#
# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in
#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with
#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not
#   work with the default configuration.

	# Enabling HTTP/2 on your Apache Server has impact on the resource consumption and if you
	# have a busy site, you may need to consider carefully the implications.
	# The first noticeable thing after enabling HTTP/2 is that your server processes will start
	# additional threads. The reason for this is that HTTP/2 gives all requests that it receives
	# to its own Worker threads for processing, collects the results and streams them out to the client.
	# In the current implementation, these workers use a separate thread pool from the MPM workers that
	# you might be familiar with. This is just how things are right now and not intended to be like this forever.
	# (It might be forever for the 2.4.x release line, though.) So, HTTP/2 workers, or shorter H2Workers,
	# will not show up in mod_status. They are also not counted against directives such as ThreadsPerChild.
	# However they take ThreadsPerChild as default if you have not configured something else via H2MinWorkers and H2MaxWorkers.

	H2Upgrade on

	#One problem that you experience in the image gallery might be that Apache, by default,
	#is willing to accept up to 100 streams per connection.
	# So, a HTTP/2 browser will throw all 70 thumbnail requests in parallel at the server
	# and they will, more or less, consume 70 times the memory that you would see over HTTP/1.
	# One way to test this is to reduce the number of concurrent streams with the
	# H2MaxSessionStreams directive. Maybe you could try:
	H2MaxSessionStreams 10

	# This directive sets the maximum number of worker threads to spawn per child process for HTTP/2 processing.
	# If this directive is not used, mod_http2 will chose a value suitable for the mpm module loaded.
	H2MaxWorkers 20

# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
